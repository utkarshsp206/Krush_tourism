            <h1 class="Atitle">  The Statue of Unity </h1>
            <p class="Apara"> <b>Brief History:</b> The statue has been built as an ode to the
                 Iron Man of India, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first home minister of 
                 independent India. He was responsible for uniting all 562 princely states 
                 of the country to build the Republic of India.<br><br>

                <b>About Place:</b> October 31st, 2018, marked the inauguration of the world’s 
                tallest statue – the Statue of Unity, against the backdrop of the dramatic Satpura
                 and Vindhyachal hills in Kevadia, Gujarat. The 182-metre (600 feet aprox.) statue 
                 is dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the architect of independent India. The 
                 colossal monument towers over River Narmada, a tribute to India ‘from the people 
                 of Gujarat’ to the leader who placed people’s welfare first. The Statue of Unity
                  overlooks the vast surrounds and the river basin of the Narmada River and the
                   sprawling Sardar Sarovar dam. It stands on the Sadhu Bet hillock, connected 
                   by a 300-metre bridge, which offers access from the mainland to the statue.<br><br>
                
                As a part of an outreach programme for the project, the state government
                 had asked Indian farmers to donate their used farming equipment to collect
                  iron needed for the statue of Sardar Patel. Eventually, about 5000 tonnes 
                  of iron is believed to be collected. Details of the construction and history 
                  of the leader can be seen in an in-house museum, inside the statue.<br><br>
                
               <b> Laser Light and Sound Show:</b> A Light and Sound show using laser technology 
               projected on the Statue of Unity takes place every evening except Monday. 
               The colourful laser lighting system is accompanied by an excellent narration 
               of the history and life of Sardar Patel, his contribution to the Independence 
               Movement and the unification of India as one nation.<br><br>  </p>

            <h1 class="Atitle"> National Salt Satyagraha Memorial  </h1>
            <p class="Apara"> <b> About The Location: </b>The Salt Satyagraha March or The Dandi 
                March of 1930 as it is popularly known, is a landmark in the history of Indian
                 freedom struggle. As a part of the Civil Disobedience Movement against the 
                 British rule, 80 Satyagrahis led by Mahatma Gandhi marched 241-miles from
                  Sabarmati Ashram, Ahmedabad to the coastal village of Dandi and broke the 
                  Salt Law imposed by the British. As was the symbolic nature of the event,
                   it inspired millions of Indians to join the freedom struggle and brought 
                   worldwide attention to the movement. The Dandi March demonstrated the
                    effectiveness of non-violent civil disobedience as a form of protest.<br><br>

                <b>Brief History:</b> The 'National Salt Satyagraha Memorial', Dandi, Gujarat, 
                India is conceived as an experiential journey recreating the spirit and the energy
                 of the 1930 Dandi March led by Mahatma Gandhi and 80 of his fellow Satyagrahis,
                  taking the visitors to the Monument step-by-step in order to visualize and 
                  understand the history of the historic Salt March and the methodology of 
                  Satyagraha, which finally led to India’s Independence from the British 
                  colonial rule.<br><br> </p>
