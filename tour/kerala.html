            <h1 class="Atitle">Kerala – God's Own Country</h1>
            <p class="Apara">Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National 
                Geographic Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives 
                and beautiful backwaters. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its 
                varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most popular tourist destinations
                 in the world.<br><br>
                 Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists.
                  Kerala is well known for its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, 
                  mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other popular attractions in the 
                  state include the beaches at Kovalam, Muzhappilangad, Bekal and Kappad;
                   backwater tourism and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill
                    stations and resorts at Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi, Vagamon and Ponmudi;
                     and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at Wayanad, Periyar, Parambikulam,
                      Silent Valley National Park and Eravikulam National Park. The "backwaters" 
                      region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that 
                      centre on Vembanad Lake, also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, 
                      such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace,
                       are also visited. To further promote tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala
                        Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala in 2007.
                        Since then it has been held every year during the December–January period.

            <h1 class="Atitle"> Napier Museum</h1>
            <p class="Apara"> In the heart of Thiruvananthapuram city lies the great Napier 
                Museum and the Natural History Museum in the Museum compound, close to the
                 Zoological park. Built in the 19th century, it has its own natural 
                 air-conditioning system. It contains a host of historical artefacts
                  including bronze idols, ancient ornaments, a temple chariot and ivory carvings.
                   People are especially impressed by the Japanese shadow-play leather that is
                    used to depict the epics of the Mahabharata and Ramayana.<br><br>

                Kerala's rich cultural heritage is in full display here. The museum was
                 named after the former Madras Governor General, John Napier. Also known
                  as Government Art Museum, the architectural style of museum is a mix of 
                  Indian, Chinese, Kerala and Mughal Schools of Architecture.<br><br>
                
                Visiting Hours: Open 10:00 - 16:45 hrs. Closed on Mondays, Wednesday forenoons, 
                January 26th, August 15th, Thiruvonam and Mahanavami.<br><br>

            <h1 class="Atitle"> Athirappilly and Vazhachal Waterfalls in Thrissur</h1>
            <p class="Apara">As you walk down the stone slabs that lead to the base of the
                 Athirappilly waterfalls, a mysterious serenity overcomes you. It is Kerala's 
                 most famous and largest waterfall at over 80 ft high. The sight of the water
                  crashing onto the ground leaves you with a sense of wonder at the sheer power
                   and magnificence of nature. Located around 63 km from Thrissur district, it 
                   is a perennial picnic spot for people in the area and  beyond. Its surrounding
                    greenery is perfect for walks and picnics with loved ones. Lying at the 
                    entrance to the Sholayar forest ranges, it is a part of the Chalakudy River 
                    which calls the Western Ghats its home.<br><br>

                Barely 5 km away is another family favourite, Vazhachal Waterfalls. These 
                waterfalls became famous for not just their view but the endemic species 
                found in the surrounding dense forests. Researchers have found four endangered
                 species of the Hornbill here, the only place they thrive in the entire Western
                  Ghats. Ornithologists attach great significance to this location and bird
                   watchers can come across many rare and vibrant species in these parts. <br><br> </p>
            <img src="ke4.jpg" alt=""><br><br>

            <h1 class="Atitle"> Alappuzha  </h1>
            <p class="Apara"> Referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always 
                enjoyed an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is 
                famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, marine products and 
                coir industry. Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic spot. The pier, which
                 extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years old. Entertainment 
                 facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the attraction of the beach. 
                 There is also an old lighthouse nearby which greatly intrigues all visitors.<br><br>

                Another delightful experience while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The
                 houseboats you find in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version
                  of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’,
                   refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, 
                   kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used 
                   to carry tons of rice and spices. <br><br>    
                Houseboats are available at Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Kottayam, Allappuzha,
                 Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kasaragod.<br><br>   </p>

            <h1 class="Atitle">Silent Valley National Park in Palakkad   </h1>
            <p class="Apara">Located in the Northeast corner of Palakkad district, 
                Silent Valley was named a National Park only in 1984. It was called
                 'Sairandhrivanam' as it was here that Sairandhiri (the secret identity
                  donned by Panchali, from the epic Mahabharata) is believed to have hidden
                   along with her five husbands, the Pandavas, while escaping their cruel cousins,
                    the Kauravas. The Kunthippuzha River which feeds the entire forest was named 
                    after Kunthi, mother of the Pandavas. It is shielded by the Nilgiri Plateau
                     to the North and the Mannarkkad Plains to the South. It constitutes the 
                     centrepiece of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, an integral part of the
                      Western Ghats, christened a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2012.<br><br>

                The flora and fauna found here makes one wonder if this ecosystem has survived 
                since the very beginning of time. From tigers, leopards, elephants, snakes, 
                Lion-Tailed Macaques and Malabar Giant Squirrels to moths, bugs and toads, 
                the diversity in fauna is breath-taking. Along with them, one can view over
                 1,000 species of flowering plants and another 110 species of orchids that 
                 enchant all who see them. Over 400 species of moths and 200 species of
                  butterflies have been catalogued here. The 128 species of beetles deserve 
                  a special mention since 10 of them were previously unknown to mankind.<br><br>

            <h1 class="Atitle"> Vagamon in Idukki  </h1>
            <p class="Apara">  Vagamon hill station in Idukki is among the few spots on the
                 planet that need to be experienced first-hand to truly discover its glory.
                  The grassy hills, velvet lawns and overall mysticism of the place cannot be 
                  replicated anywhere else in the world. This quaint town lies untouched by any
                   modern influences and is neatly tucked away in Idukki district. Visitors can
                    avail many activities including trekking, paragliding, mountaineering and 
                    rock climbing. People love travelling across a chain of three famous hills:
                     Thangal, Murugan and Kurisumala. These are important to Hindus, Muslims and 
                     Christians, respectively, and are a perfect example of the communal harmony
                      prevalent in the place. The Kurisumala monks have an enchanting dairy farm
                       nearby that is an absolute delight to visit.<br><br> </p>
